# simpletest

A super simple test-runner for in-browser personal projects.  Primarily
for my own usage so I don't have to keep shunting this file around.

### usage

1. Import from jsDelivr, pull down from github/npm (whatever floats your
   boat) into html with javascript you want to test.
2. Look at test.html for an example of how to run it
3. Run a server in the root of your directory (i.e. `static-server`)
4. Navigate to the html page in your browser (i.e.
   `localhost:9080/test.html`)
5. Open the developer console, and behold your tests in all their glory
